Nâzım Hikmet’s poems <i>In the Snowy Beech Forest</i> and <i>On Living</i>, co-translated with <a href="https://www.lydiasthost.com" target="_blank">Lydia Host</a>, to be published in <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine" target="_blank"><i>Poetry Magazine</i></a>

Founded in Chicago by Harriet Monroe in 1912, <i>Poetry</i> is the oldest monthly devoted to verse in the English-speaking world. The most succinct statement of Poetry’s mission is to print the best poetry written today, in whatever style, genre, or approach. The magazine established its reputation early by publishing the first important poems of T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, H.D., William Carlos Williams, Carl Sandburg, and other now-classic authors. In succeeding decades it has presented—often for the first time—works by virtually every significant poet of the 20th and 21st centuries. Poetry has always been independent, unaffiliated with any institution or university—or with any single poetic or critical movement or aesthetic school. It continues to print the major English-speaking poets while presenting emerging talents in all their variety. In recent years, more than a third of the authors published in the magazine have been writers appearing for the first time. On average, the magazine receives more than 150,000 submissions per year from around the world.
